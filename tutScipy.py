# Notes on scipy:
# A large community of developers continually builds new functionality into SciPy. A good rule of
# thumb is: if you are thinking about implementing a numerical routine into your code, check the
# SciPy documentation website first. Chances are, if it's a common task, someone will have
# added it to SciPy.
